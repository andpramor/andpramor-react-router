# üöÄ React Router From Scratch

In this project, I‚Äôm built a **custom React router** from the ground up! It's a full-fledged routing system that powers Single Page Applications (SPAs) with smooth navigation, just like popular routers. Once tested, the router will be extracted into an installable package and published to **NPM**.

## üåü Features

- **Single Page Application (SPA) Navigation**: Achieve seamless page transitions without reloading the page, giving your app a dynamic feel.
- **Back/Forward Navigation**: Enable navigation through browser history (back/forward buttons), offering a user-friendly experience.
- **Declarative `<Link />` Component**: Easily link to other pages within the app with a simple `<Link>` component, similar to how React Router works.
- **Declarative `<Router />` Component**: Define routes declaratively, making routing intuitive and easy to manage within your app.
- **404 Handling (Default Route)**: Automatically direct users to a 404 page or a default route when a page is not found.
- **Route Parameters**: Pass dynamic data through the URL, allowing for flexible routing patterns (e.g.: `/user/:id`).
- **Declarative `<Route />` Component**: Define specific routes for each page in your app, controlling which components should render based on the URL.
- **Lazy Loading for Routes**: Boost performance by loading route components lazily, only when they‚Äôre needed.
- **Internationalization (i18n)**: Support multiple languages and localization, allowing pages to adapt based on the user's language given by the activated route.
- **Testing**: Ensure the router behaves as expected testing its methods.
- **Publish to NPM**: Package the router and share it with the community by publishing it to **NPM**.

```bash
npm install andpramor-react-router
```

Stay tuned for updates as I continue to build this project from scratch!
